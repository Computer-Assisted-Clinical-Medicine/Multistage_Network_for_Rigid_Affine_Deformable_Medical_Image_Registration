# Multistage Network for Rigid Affine Deformable Medical Image Registration
This repository contains the implementation of a multistage network for rigid-affine-deformable medical image registration.
In order to provide a benchmark for comparison, we integrated a multistage network for affine-deformable registration into the framework. 
The framework was implemented using Keras with Tensorflow backend.
